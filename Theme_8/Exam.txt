1. Find the two repeating elements in a given array.
You are given an array of n+2 elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to n. 
And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.

For example, array = {4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1} and n = 5
The above array has n + 2 = 7 elements with all elements occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice.
So the output should be 4 2.


Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the total number of test cases. 
Then T test cases follow Each test case consists of two lines. 
First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the range of numbers to be inserted in array of size N+2.
Second line of each test case contains the N+2 space separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output:
Print the two elements occuring twice in the array. 
Order of the two elements must be preserved as in the original list, i.e., print the element which arrives first(2nd time).

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 100


Example:

INPUT
1
4
1 2 1 3 4 3
OUTPUT
1 3
